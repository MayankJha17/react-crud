Sample crud project for react

# React is javascript library often times it used as framework

# Popular because of use in single page application for example , going from one page(or link/button) to another it does not reload

# React use JSX (Javascript syntax extension) for details check link https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html

# By using JSX we can divide page/website into components and each component can develop differently and does not dependent to each other.

# Routing simply means , example going page from /index.html to page /index.html/videos therefore going from one page to another and in react we can achieve routing by using react router dom package

# https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html

# For react routing we need to install package react router dom .

# Props are read only i.e it can't be changed in component.

# npm install react-router-dom

# npm install gh-pages
